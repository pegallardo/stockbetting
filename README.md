# stockbetting
Stock market-like betting system Spring Boot based project

Java 23
Spring Boot 3.4.2

Features of a Stock Market-Like Betting System:

1. Dynamic Odds: Odds change based on market trends and bets placed.
2. Outcome Prediction: Predict future outcomes based on historical data (e.g., prices, volume, events).
3. Trading Strategy Testing: Simulate strategies to optimize returns.

Dataset Example (stock_data.csv):

Open	High	Low	Close	Volume	Label
100.5	105.2	99.3	104.7	1500000	1
104.7	106.1	103.4	105.8	1200000	1
105.8	106.0	100.7	101.3	1800000	0

Features: Open, High, Low, Close, Volume.
Label: 1 (Stock goes up), 0 (Stock goes down).

Key Points to consider:
1. Cross-Validation: Added with parameter tuning for regParam and elasticNetParam.
2. Feature Scaling: StandardScaler ensures all features have the same scale.
3. Pipeline: Streamlines preprocessing and training steps.
4. Apache Spark for Big Data: Efficient for processing large-scale historical stock datasets.

API will include endpoints for:
1. Real-time data feeds: Fetch stock data (mocked or from an external API like Alpha Vantage).
2. Machine learning predictions: Use trained models to predict stock trends and provide betting odds.
3. Simulated trading strategies: Allow users to test betting/trading strategies based on historical or simulated data.
